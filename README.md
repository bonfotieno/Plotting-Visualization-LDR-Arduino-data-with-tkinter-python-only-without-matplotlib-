Plotting Visualization of LDR+Arduino data with tkinter+python only(without-matplotlib). 
This project is a basic demonstration of how you can plot a graph with python+tkinter without matplotlib or any other plotting libraries. 
1. git clone the repository 
2. Upload the arduino code to your arduino 
3. Connect LDR to arduino according to the circuit diagram 
4. Start Botien-plot-lab script
